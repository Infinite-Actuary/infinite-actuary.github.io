Just for fun I applied to an Actuarial Intern position at [Ameritas](https://www.ameritas.com/) today. [Ameritas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameritas) is a Life Insurance company headquartered right here in Lincoln. Yes, I already have a job lined up as a TA. But you can't do better than corporate experience in your field of study. It would give me a taste of what it's like to actually be an Actuary. It would be a shame if I worked hard to get all of my accreditations to find the work ill-fitting. Plus, it pays better $)

P.S. The Ameritas logo really confused me at first. I now know it's a Bison with a rather large stylized void on its flank. However, I originally mistook this void to be white space and my brain omitted the line between the hump and tail, leaving behind some weird [Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur) figure.
