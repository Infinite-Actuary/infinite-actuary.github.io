### The semester is underway! and.. my first bill has arrived :(

Most importantly, the `Grad Asst Tuition` pays for both the graduate tuition and CBA tuition fees for a total of `$3,652.25`. In addition to this (not shown above), I get monthly payments of `$935.25` for my work as a TA.

Students are responsible for paying 21% of the UNL-offered health insurance premium, which amounts to $996.05 for 9 months of coverage. This works out to be about $110/month. After reviewing the [student health insurance ](http://health.unl.edu/studentinsurance) with my wife, we decided to decline it in favor of continuing on her employer-provided insurance plan. Her plan provides roughly the same benefits for ~$20 less each month.

The other fees:

* Library Fee: $62.50
* Facilities Fee: $602
* Technology Fee: $110

Those fees seem a bit excessive to me. It would be helpful if they were unbundled further so that I could see exactly what I'm paying for and give me the choice to opt out of anything that has no forseeable utility.

In total, my first bill comes to **$809.50** and thanks to a *Grad Assist Deferment*, I have until Oct 12th to pay it. My first month's paycheck should cover all of it. So much for that paycheck.

Other expenditures on the horizon are for Actuarial Exam [fees](https://www.soa.org/Education/Exam-Req/Syllabus-Study-Materials/Exam-and-Module-Fees.aspx). I plan on taking Exam P at the beginning of [January](https://www.soa.org/Education/Exam-Req/Exam-Day-Info/edu-2018-cbt-test-schedule.aspx). That way, I will have all of winter break to study and prepare for it. I recently had a classmate tell me about [Coaching Actuaries](https://www.coachingactuaries.com).

They offer adaptive practice exams and claim that if you earn a level of 7 or more on their scoring system, you have a 90% chance of passing the exam on the first go.

I plan on using a 30 day Adapt ($85 with their 15% student discount) for the month of December. I'll let you know what I think of it in a future blog post :)
