### A simple [blog](https://infinite-actuary.github.io/) where I can collect my thoughts and scratch my head of over the concerns of an Actuary.

I'm a Math major with a minor in CS. I finished my undergrad in 2011 and have spent about 5 years working for various companies such as [The Buckle](https://www.buckle.com/), [VWR](https://www.vwr.com/) & [Xpanxion](http://www.xpanxion.com/) in Software Developer or SDET roles.

After a series of realizations. I decided that Actuarial Science would be a better fit for my interests and skill set.[Why?](http://www.beanactuary.org/why/) Mainly because I'm good at math and like solving problems. I tried my hand in the software development industry but always felt lacking in skill or incompetent with the latest language or tooling. As a mild introvert and someone with a mind for structure, I began to loath [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) and craved periods of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) that would allow mastery over a subject.
