### Just a simple place for me to collect my thoughts while scratching my head of over the concerns of an Actuary.

I'm a Math major with a minor in CS. I graduated in 2011 and have spent about 5 years working for various companies such as
[The Buckle](https://www.buckle.com/), [VWR](https://www.vwr.com/) & [Xpanxion](http://www.xpanxion.com/) in various roles such
as Software Developer or SDET.

[Why?](http://www.beanactuary.org/why/) Mainly because I'm good at math and like solving problems. I tried my hand in the
software development (web dev & backend sql) industry but alway felt lacking in skill or incompetent with the latest language 
or tooling.
