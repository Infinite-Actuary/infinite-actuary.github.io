### A simple [blog](https://infinite-actuary.github.io/) where I can collect my thoughts and scratch my head of over the concerns of an Actuary.

I'm a Math major with a minor in CS. I finished my undergrad in 2011 and have spent about 5 years working for various companies such as [The Buckle](https://www.buckle.com/), [VWR](https://www.vwr.com/) & [Xpanxion](http://www.xpanxion.com/) in Software Developer or [SDET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Development_Engineer_in_Test) roles.

After a series of realizations, I decided that Actuarial Science would be a better fit for my interests and skill set.[Why?](http://www.beanactuary.org/why/) Mainly because I'm good at math and like solving problems. I tried my hand in the software development industry but always felt lacking in skill or incompetent with the latest language or tooling.

As a mild introvert and someone with a desire for structure, I began to loath [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) and craved periods of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) that would allow mastery over a subject.

So, with my wifes full and loving support, I applied to the Actuarial Science program at UNL and here were are! I thought it would be nice to document my experience for the posterity of those who are interested in the program or what it takes to be an Actuary in general.

Of course, if I could just pass all of the [SOA exams](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/) on my own I wouldn't need this program at all. But I find education to be valuable, not to mention the connections formed and wisdom gained during the process.

P.s. If you are reading this, know that this blog is very low on the list of my priorities. As coursework ramps up, I fully expect my blogging frequency to fizzle out.
